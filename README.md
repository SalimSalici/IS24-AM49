## Running the Game
The game is divided into two JAR files, available for download from the [Deliverables directory](path to dir).
<br>To start a non-local game, ensure that a Server application instance is running before the client attempts to connect.</br>


### Running the Server

```sh
java -jar target/server.jar
```

### Running the Client

#### GUI Mode

```sh
java -jar target/client.jar --gui
```

#### CLI Mode

```sh
java -jar target/client.jar
```

To play the game using a socket connection, add the --socket option to the client command.

## Testing

The project includes extensive unit tests to ensure the correctness and stability of the implementation.    

## Documentation

### Javadoc

The complete Javadoc documentation can be generated by running:

```sh
mvn javadoc:javadoc
```
