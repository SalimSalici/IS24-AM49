## Project Information

The project involves the development of a software version of the Codex Naturalis board game. The final version includes:
- High-level and detailed UML diagrams generated from the source code.
- A working game implementation that adheres to the official rules.
- Documentation of the communication protocol between client and server.
- Source code of unit tests.
- Javadoc documentation generated from the code.

## Running the Game
The game is divided into two JAR files, available for download from the [Deliverables directory](path to dir).
<br>To start a non-local game, ensure that a Server application instance is running before the client attempts to connect.</br>


### Running the Server
To start the server, use the following command with the required arguments:

```sh
java -jar target/server.jar --host <server-ip> --r <rmi-port> --s <socket-port>
```
Replace <server-ip> with the server's IP address, <rmi-port> with the desired RMI port, and <socket-port> with the desired socket port.

If you want to enable the "disconnection resilience" feature, you can use the --persistence argument:
```sh
java -jar target/server.jar --host <server-ip> --r <rmi-port> --s <socket-port> --persistence
```

### Running the Client

#### GUI Mode

```sh
java -jar target/client.jar --gui
```

#### CLI Mode

```sh
java -jar target/client.jar
```

For those playing from the CLI, you can disable the use of colors by adding the --disable-tui-colors option:

```sh
java -jar target/client.jar --disable-tui-colors
```
\
Additionally, you can specify the server IP, port, and connection type directly from the command line:

 ##### For socket connection:
```sh
java -jar target/client.jar --host <server-ip> --port <port> --socket
```

##### For RMI connection:
```sh
java -jar target/client.jar --host <server-ip> --port <port> --rmi
```

## Testing

The project includes extensive unit tests to ensure the correctness and stability of the implementation.

**Test Coverage:**

| Package    | Class Coverage | Method Coverage | Line Coverage |
|------------|----------------|-----------------|---------------|
| Controller | 100%           | 93%             | 91%           |
| Model      | 100%           | 94%             | 90%           |    

## Documentation

### Javadoc

The complete Javadoc documentation can be generated by running:
